- Fixed check for if Atlas should despawn in multiplayer, now checks if anyone is nearby instead of if his target is dead
- Atlas now rises up into the sky gradually (but quickly) instead of instantly rocketing off
- Made Shadow Ghoul spawn above and belowground to make it easier to find
- Changed all spawns that require a Marble or Granite spawn tile to spawn to instead just check that the player is in the respective biome
- Significantly improved Briar spawn check, should avoid desert
- Fixed the lack of cloning between SpiritAccessory items potentially causing issues
