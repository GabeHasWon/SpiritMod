v1.5.0.25
- Added a bunch of checks and additional conditions by Remnants dev Wombat, thanks!
- Fixed Naturalists Workshop only needing a 2 tile anchor despite being 3 tiles wide
- Made Soul Shred draw fullbright instead of 70% bright for some reason
- Fixed Kelp generating on sloped tiles then breaking (lol)
- Made Naturalist's Workshop not a "table" tile (only technically, it didn't count as a table for rooms anyways)
- Made Gravestones not land on top of Naturalist's Workshops
