Introducing a variety of bosses, biomes, weapons, events, and mechanics, Spirit is one of Terraria’s largest content mods. 
Spirit has been developed by a team of passionate modders since 2015, with the goal of expanding the vanilla experience and breathing new immersive life into your world. 
Since then, the mod has continued to grow and evolve, boasting over 3 million downloads in its lifetime on 1.3.5.
After another long update, Spirit is ready to take on 1.4.4, and showcase what it can do in the future.

We hope you enjoy!

----- FAQ -----
Q: Is this mod compatible with <Other Mod>?
A: With the exception of Remnants and Builder's Essentials, and some minor visual issues with Polarities, yes.
This mod is compatible with Calamity and Thorium, and all other known content mods. 
Calamity WILL overshadow both Thorium and Spirit, however, as it is balanced around itself instead of vanilla.

Q: I'm getting a crash during world gen. How do I fix it?
A: If you're using Remnants or Builder's Essentials, disable them. Both mods stop Spirit from generating.
If you're trying to use Polarities, there are some issues when selecting a world. 
This should not affect anything, and worlds can be made as normal. Gameplay should also be unaffected.

Q: How do I get the quest book?
A: Find the Adventurer in the underground Briar, and get the quest book from him.
