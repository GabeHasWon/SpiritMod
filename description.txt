Introducing a variety of bosses, biomes, weapons, events, and mechanics, Spirit is one of Terraria’s largest content mods. 
Spirit has been developed by a team of passionate modders since 2015, with the goal of expanding the vanilla experience and breathing new immersive life into your world. 
Since then, the mod has continued to grow and evolve, boasting over 3 million downloads in its lifetime on 1.3.5.
After another long update, Spirit is ready to take on 1.4.4, and showcase what it can do in the future.

We hope you enjoy!

----- FAQ -----
Q: Is this mod compatible with <Other Mod>?
A: This mod is compatible with Calamity and Thorium, and all other known content mods. Report issues if there are any.
Calamity WILL overshadow both Thorium and Spirit, however, as it is balanced around itself instead of vanilla.

Q: How do I get the quest book?
A: Find the Adventurer in the underground Briar, and get the quest book from him.
